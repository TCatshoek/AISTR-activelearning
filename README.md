### Quickstart
Make sure you have graphviz installed and in your PATH. 
You will also need python >=3.6 

Windows users might want to set up WSL or run this assignment in a VM.

- Clone this repository
  
    `git clone git@github.com:TCatshoek/AISTR-activelearning.git`

    `cd AISTR-activelearning`
  

- Create a virtual environment
  
  `python -m venv venv`
  

- Activate the virtual environment
  
    `source venv/bin/activate`
  

- Install STMLearn

    `pip install stmlearn`
  

Try running the example in the `Task1` folder.
```
python Task1/example.py
```
If everything is set up correctly you should see a state machine pop up after a few seconds.

Each task's folder contains a separate README file with further instructions. Good luck!
